		<h3><strong>Cloud Union Customer Terms and Conditions</strong></h3><br>
		<span style = "padding:2%">Version 2 â€“ effective [7-17] 2018 </span><br> 
            <p style="padding:2%;color:black">Welcome to the Cloud Union member centre and online shop platform (Platform) operated by Cloud Union (Australia) Network Technology Pty Limited (Cloud Union, we, our, us). </p><br>
		<p style = "padding:2%;color:black">By applying to become a member of the Platform, you agree to these terms and conditions, which govern your use and membership of the Platform and participation in our Loyalty Scheme (as described below) (Terms). In addition to agreeing to these Terms, to commence using the Platform and participating in our Loyalty Scheme you must have completed our application process (the details of which are set out on the Platform and/or our website), including by providing all information requested by us.</p><br>
		<span style = "padding:2%"><strong>Purchase of goods and services on the Platform </strong></span><br> 
		<p style = "padding:2%;color:black">The Platform promotes the purchase of goods and services by customers from participating merchants and other diamond members (such merchants and diamond customers collectively referred to as Merchants in these Terms). We enter into agreements with Merchants to offer their goods and services (Products) on the Platform to our customers.</p><br>
            
            <p style="padding:2%;color:black">When you purchase a Product via the Platform (referred to as an Online Transaction), you will pay the relevant Merchant using Australia dollars (AUD) from your Prepayment Account (as defined below) or OzPD from your Transaction Account (as defined below).</p><br>
		<p style = "padding:2%;color:black">In the case of both Online Transactions and Offline Transactions the Merchant supplies the Product to you directly, and the contractual arrangements for the sale and supply are between you and the Merchant.</p><br>
		<p style = "padding:2%;color:black">The Platform is independent from the sale and purchase transactions between you and our Merchants. We have no responsibility for ensuring that the Products are delivered by the Merchant once the transaction is completed. We do not guarantee that the descriptions of the Products on the Platform are accurate, complete, reliable, up-to-date or error-free, or that the Products are free from defects, of a satisfactory quality or compliant with applicable laws. If a Product you purchase does not comply with the Product's description or applicable laws, or is otherwise defective, damaged or not of a satisfactory quality, then it is up to you raise this directly with the relevant Merchant and (if applicable) request a replacement of or refund for the Product. We have no responsibility for providing you with a replacement or refund for the Product.</p><br>
		<p style = "padding:2%;color:black">If we are satisfied that you have received a refund for a Product from a Merchant, we may reverse or cancel the number of Gift Points (as defined below) you were gifted in respect of the purchase of that Product.</p><br>
		<span style = "padding:2%"><strong>Loyalty Scheme </strong></span><br> 
		<p style = "padding:2%;color:black">We operate a Loyalty Scheme which rewards customers and Merchants for sales transactions in respect of Products.</p><br>

            <span style="padding:2%;font-style:italic;">Gift Points and Oz Points</span><br>
		<p style = "padding:2%;color:black">When you purchase a Product via the Platform, you will receive "gift points" (Gift Points) from us in relation to that Online Transaction.</p><br>
		<p style = "padding:2%;color:black">When you purchase a Product as part of an Offline Transaction, you will only receive gift points in relation to that Offline Transaction if the Merchant subsequently enters details of the Offline Transaction on the Platform and the Merchant has sufficient "trading points" (being points allocated by us which Merchants must obtain in order to sell their Products via the Platform) (Trading Points) for the transaction. We will not be liable or responsible for you not receiving Gift Points due to any failure by a Merchant to enter the details of any of your Offline Transactions on the Platform (either at all, or accurately), or any Merchant not having sufficient Trading Points for an Offline Transaction.</p><br>
            
            <p style="padding:2%;color:black">The number of Gift Points will be calculated at the rate of 100 Gift Points per complete one (1) AUD of the price for the Product (excluding GST or any other form of value-added or sales tax) or at such other rate as we may specify on the Platform or our website from time to time.</p><br>
            
            <p style="padding:2%;color:black">As long as you have at least 10,000 Gift Points (or such other number of Gift Points as we may specify on the Platform or our website from time to time) (Conversion Threshold Number), your Gift Points will automatically convert to Oz points (Oz Points) on a daily basis in accordance with our formula and whether or not you purchase any other Products.  When a Gift Point is converted, that Gift Point will be deducted from your Gift Points account. While you have less than the Conversion Threshold Number of Gift Points, these points will not convert to Oz Points.</p><br>
            
            <p style="padding:2%;color:black">The rate at which Gift Points are converted to Oz Points depends on the number and value of transactions undertaken across the Platform on a daily basis. We do not guarantee how many Gift Points can be converted to Oz Points on any given day or how long it will take to convert all of your Gift Points in excess of the Conversion Threshold Number into Oz Points. It may take a number of years for all of your Gift Points in excess of the Conversion Threshold Number to convert to Oz Points. Gift Points cannot be used by you for any purpose. They simply represent your Gift Points balance that may (to the extent it exceeds the Conversion Threshold Number) be converted to Oz Points.  </p><br>
            
            <span style="padding:2%;font-style:italic;">Oz Point Dollars (OzPD)</span><br>
            
            <p style="padding:2%;color:black">When you have accrued at least 10,000 Oz Points (or such other number of Oz Points as we may specify on the Platform or our website from time to time), you may redeem some or all of the Oz Points and receive "Oz point dollars" (OzPD). When a Oz Point is redeemed, that Oz Point will be deducted from your Oz Points account.</p><br>
            
            <p style="padding:2%;color:black">The rate for redeeming Oz Points for OzPD shall be OzPD1 for every 100 Oz Points (or such other rate as we may specify on the Platform or our website from time to time), less a redemption deduction of 10% (or such other percentage as we may specify on the Platform or our website from time to time). For example, if 10,000 Oz Points are redeemed and the redemption rate is 100 Oz Points = OzPD1, OzPD90 would be credited to your OzPD "transaction account" which we maintain within the Platform (Transaction Account).</p><br>
            
            <p style="padding:2%;color:black">OzPD are the form of units used to measure the value of your accrued rewards under the Loyalty Scheme. OzPD1 is equivalent to one (1) Australia dollar (AUD) (although this is subject to any changes we may make to the Loyalty Scheme in the manner described below).</p><br>
            
              <p style="padding:2%;color:black">OzPD in your Transaction Account may either be transferred to AUD or used to purchase Products via the Platform. OzPD cannot be used for Offline Transactions, or transferred to your Prepayment Account. </p><br>
            
            <p style="padding:2%;color:black">Where you elect to transfer OzPD in your Transaction Account to AUD, we will transfer the relevant amount of AUD, less a transfer deduction of 3% (or such other percentage as we may specify on the Platform or our website from time to time), to your nominated bank account. We will not pay physical notes, coins, cheques or other negotiable instruments. For example, if you elect to transfer OzPD100 to AUD, we will transfer AUD97 to your nominated bank account.</p><br>
            
            <p style="padding:2%;color:black">When using OzPD to purchase Products, you must have sufficient OzPD in your Transaction Account to complete the relevant purchase using only OzPD. If you do not have sufficient OzPD in order to complete the purchase, you would need to pay the full purchase price in AUD from your Prepayment Account (as defined below).  </p><br>
            
            <p style="padding:2%;color:black">We will debit your Transaction Account for the amount of the purchase made using OzPD. We do not make a deduction or charge a fee where you use OzPD to purchase a Product. </p><br>
            
            <p style="padding:2%;color:black">Any OzPD which you may receive or be credited with, for any reason and whether held in your Transaction Account or any other account, shall expire and be removed from your Transaction or other account 2 years after they are received or credited. You shall not be entitled to any refund or other compensation upon or in connection with the expiry of your OzPD.</p><br>
            
            <span style="padding:2%;font-style:italic">Changes to, and suspension or termination of, Loyalty Scheme </span><br>
            
            <p style="padding:2%;color:black">We can (at our discretion) change, temporarily suspend or terminate the Loyalty Scheme or the basis on which Gift Points, Oz Points and/or OzPD can be earned, converted, redeemed, transferred and/or used at any time. If we terminate or make any material changes to the Loyalty Scheme, we will give at least 30 days' prior notice of this on the Platform and/or our website and/or by emailing or texting the notification to you. During this notice period you may redeem your accrued Oz Points and use and/or transfer your OzPD in your Transaction Account. Upon any such termination, your Gift Points, any unredeemed Oz Points and your OzPD will be forfeited (and, for clarity, there will be no obligation whatsoever for us to pay or compensate you for such forfeiture). </p><br>
            
            <span style="padding:2%"><strong>Prepayment Account </strong></span><br>
            
            <p style="padding:2%;color:black">We will establish a AUD prepayment account for you within the Platform (Prepayment Account). Prepayment Accounts can be credited with AUD at any time by making a payment using the payment mechanism made available on the Platform or our website from time to time. </p><br>
            
            <p style="padding:2%;color:black">AUD in your Prepayment Account may only be used to purchase Products via the Platform. You may not transfer AUD in your Prepayment Account to your bank account or Transaction Account, and we are not required to refund or repay any AUD in your Prepayment Account.</p><br>
            
            <span style="padding:2%"><strong>Money</strong></span><br>

            <p style="padding:2%;color:black">All money you pay to us (including payments to your Prepayment Account) is non-refundable and held by us for our own account. No transaction made by you via the Platform will result in us holding, administering or managing money on behalf of you or money to which you have a right to repayment. No person other than us has any right to interest earned on money held by us in any account.</p><br>
            
            <p style="padding:2%;color:black">Gift Points and Oz Points are not money and are not a form of virtual or crypto currency. They have no monetary value, and they do not represent interest or dividends.</p><br>

		<span style = "padding:2%"><strong>Your obligations</strong></span><br>
		<p style = "padding:2%;color:black">You are responsible for establishing and maintaining your membership account on the Platform. You warrant to us at all times that all information you give to us, whether as part of the application process or otherwise, is accurate and complete. You must update any of your details on the Platform so that they remain up-to-date at all times.</p><br>
		<p style = "padding:2%;color:black">You must keep your membership number and your user name and password details for your online Platform account secure.</p><br>
		<p style = "padding:2%;color:black">You are only permitted to have one membership account on the Platform. You must not allow any other person to use your membership number to try to earn points on your account and you must not use any other personâ€™s membership number to earn points on their account.</p><br>
